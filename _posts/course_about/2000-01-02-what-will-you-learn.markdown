In Learning Design 101 you’ll produce a course that works like the web--networked, open, community-driven and sustainable. You’ll develop your course using the methodologies we use at P2PU to build learning communities on the web. From “jump” you’ll be in the thick of:

* How learning communities work and design principles
* Pedagogies that prize interaction and feedback
* Nurturing creative serendipity in small groups
* Selecting the right open platform for your course
* Building an audience by building with your audience
* Defining success and iterating on your course design
