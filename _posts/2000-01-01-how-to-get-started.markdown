(Running online courses is exactly like that).

We’re betting you’d like to run a course. We’re eager to help you. The purpose of this program is to support your design using the tools and methods we tap here at P2PU. 

**Peer 2 Peer University attracts people who think differently about education.** Our [Play With Your Music][1] course started because we wanted to learn music by tinkering with the tunes we already love--not drill "chopsticks" on the piano for hours. Our [Copyright for Educators][2] course exists because librarians and teachers all over the world wondered which materials they could remix for their classrooms. Our [School of Ed][3] connects teachers with each other and cooks up dynamic, meaningful professional development. 

**All of this is to say that P2PU tends to question where the power comes from in a learning experience.** Here's a few ways that comes across in what we do:

 - **Freedom**. The learners are in charge. All courses are free and under an open license (CC-BY-SA).
 - **Choice**. Participate in the way you’d like to, using the tools you are curious about. 
 - **Networked**. We help you find your crew of like-minded folks to make things together, critique each other, and generally feel comfy on the internet.
 - **Support**. We offer tools, guides and feedback to help folks create great learning experiences on the web.

And once a week we get together and hatch plans on Google Hangout:

# What Happens When You Learn in Community?

 - You 

# Brass Tacks

- **What's this course like?.**  This course will begin on the 1st of every month. We'd estimate that you'll have a course in about 2-3 weeks. Each piece of the course will consist of big ideas, examples, projects, and good ideas from other people. 

- **What's the P2PU vibe?** We'll be working together the P2PU way. You'll share your ideas with others, give feedback, iterate, and then build a concrete part of your course. At the end of the program you’ll have a series of design principles to work from, a core community to participate with, draft activities to use in your course, and familiarity with the tools and platforms to get started. 

- **Do you <3 hackpad?** We do. We heartily recommend this suuuuuper easily collaborative tool: https://hackpad.com. If it's not your bag, any text document that you can share will do for now :)

# P2PU Examples of Triggering Events

To kickstart our online courses, we spark "triggering events." These can look like controversial dilemmas, open-ended questions, setting goals together, or group reflection. The goal of these activities is to ask folks to participate, engage others, cohere and reflect on their learning. 

In our "[Deeper Learning MOOC][4]" (a collaboration with [High Tech High][5]) learners have a "Tweet of the Week" in order to:

> ...encourage DLMOOC participants to share their learning with the rest of the world, we will have a suggested tweet of the week. Of note: having students present their work to an audience beyond their teacher is, in our view, part of what deeper learning is all about.

The first "Tweet of the Week" asks learners to define what "Deeper Learning" means to them personally.

In the [Copyright for Educators][6] course, the facilitators do some collaborative goal-setting by asking folks what they hope to learn when they sign up.

# Projects

Take to your hackpad!!

## Project 1: What makes a good learning experience?
What is the the last memorable thing that you’ve learned? Who was there? What sort of project was it? What kind of mood were you in? 
After reading through a few others, jot down on this community hackpad [to come] some common traits that you see among them. 

## Project 2: What are the key questions you want learners to answer?
Draft a series of questions you would like learners to ask themselves, reflect on, and master in your course. Add these core questions to your hackpad, and share the URL in the comments below.

## Let Our Powers Combine: Recap.
At this point you’ve got:
a.) a group definition of what a stellar learning definition is.
b.) a draft of your learning objectives for your course.

# Good Ideas from Other People

## What Social Learning Can Do

>A networked learner can start a company with 3 people she’s never met face-to-face--but knows because they met in an open online course.

##Triggering Events

> The first phase, the triggering event, is associated with conceptualizing a problem or issue. For this reason we consider this evocative and inductive by nature. The educational processes would include presenting information that generates curiosity and questions. It should also further discussion in a way that builds into subsequent phases of inquiry. An example might be a statement and a question such as: “It has been argued that the only way to deliver effective e-learning is through a Community of Inquiry model or approach. Why do you think that is?”

D. Randy Garrison, [E-Learning in the 21st Century: A Framework for Research and Practice][7]

## Learning Objectives First!
> Backward design is a method of designing educational curriculum by setting goals before choosing instructional methods and forms of assessment. Backward design of curriculum typically involves three stages:

>  - identify the results desired
>  - determine acceptable levels of evidence that support that the desired results have occurred
>  - design activities that will make desired results happen

> Backward design challenges "traditional" methods of curriculum planning. In traditional curriculum planning, a list of content that will be taught is created and/or selected. In backward design, the educator starts with goals, creates or plans out assessments and finally makes lesson plans. Supporters of backward design liken the process to using a "road map". In this case, the destination is chosen first and then the road map is used to plan the trip to the desired destination.
