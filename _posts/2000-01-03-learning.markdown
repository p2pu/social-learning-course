## How to Design a Learning Experience that Works

[Jim Groom](http://bavatuesdays.com/) is the wizard behind the curtain at [ds106](http://ds106.us/), or Digital Storytelling 106--widely known as one of the most vibrant and successful learning communities on the internet. In this chat, we tackle:

- What were the design principles behind your course?
- How do you develop content for an open online course?
- How do you motivate learners to sustain their interest?

## What's Constructionism

I can identify examples (as an existence proof) that constructionism can work for adults as well as children.

Teachers know that if you want to learn a new subject, sign up to teach the new subject. Constructing the course and teaching it to others is a great way of developing that knowledge.

Programmers take on new projects to learn a new method, language, context, or community. My former PhD student, Mike Hewner, wanted to know what professional game development was like. Because heâ€™s an exceptional software engineer, he was able to land himself an internship with a game company one summer (with no prior game experience), explicitly to learn game development.

# Projects

## Project 6: 
Project: Choose Your Design Principles for Your Course

## Project 7: 
Take each of your learning goals and find 5-6 resources that support each goal. 

## Project 8: 
Determine what kind of project learners could make that would satisfy each learning goal. What should they demonstrate that they understand?
