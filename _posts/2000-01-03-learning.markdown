## What's Constructionism

I can identify examples (as an existence proof) that constructionism can work for adults as well as children.

Teachers know that if you want to learn a new subject, sign up to teach the new subject. Constructing the course and teaching it to others is a great way of developing that knowledge.

Programmers take on new projects to learn a new method, language, context, or community. My former PhD student, Mike Hewner, wanted to know what professional game development was like. Because he’s an exceptional software engineer, he was able to land himself an internship with a game company one summer (with no prior game experience), explicitly to learn game development.

# Projects

## Project 6: 
Project: Choose Your Design Principles for Your Course

## Project 7: 
Take each of your learning goals and find 5-6 resources that support each goal. 

## Project 8: 
Determine what kind of project learners could make that would satisfy each learning goal. What should they demonstrate that they understand?
